# Python Mini Projects

* This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that are designed to help you learn and practice your Python programming skills.

* Each project includes a README.md file that describes the project in more detail and provides instructions on how to run the project.

* To get started, you can either clone the repository to your local machine or create a new repository and add the projects to it. Once you have the projects on your local machine, you can run them by opening a terminal window and navigating to the directory where the project is located. Then, you can run the project by typing the following command:


`python [file name].py`


I hope you enjoy these Python mini projects!
